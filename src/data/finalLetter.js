// The Final Love Letter

export const finalLetter = `Dear Princess,

Its currently 03:30 AM when I start writing this, I finally finished the code for this small gift. It took me about 3 days.


I'm not very good at consistency so I usually don't finish most of my projects (Bad Habit)😩, But for you, I did 😙. So yeah,
I'm not the best at these. 

You know, I once watched Camp Rock and there was this chick who had an issue with the boyfriend opening up
soooooo he did, but his brothers told him to do it in his own language which is song. So this is mine.

Valentine's in my view is a day to specifically celebrate love, not give it on that day coz in my pov, everyday should be valentine's as long as you're breathing and have people
you deeply care about. 

Regardless, I'm happy this one is happening with you by my side, and I truly am in love with that. You're literally the wind beneath my cape
the Lane to My Clark 🥺. 

Baby, U have absolutely no idea how much I adore and love what you are, how you think, how you talk, what you stand for. You are amazing.
I truly thank God for you in my life 💖. 

By the time you're reading this, you've probably done playing the constellation game, I couldn't buy you the telescope, so in
my own little way, I tried making you a sky that you can build on yourself 💫. 

I guess I'm giving santa a run for his money being a gifter and fuel efficient (slim and all) 😂.
So this is my Valentine's at least part of it, a sky with our names engraved that you can carry on with you forever (talk to me nice and I can be upgrading this to fit more games for you)👀


I honestly didn't think I could trust anyone with my heart as I do you and you handle it with such gentleness and care, and yes, We may not know or have planned how we got here.

But as NF once said: 

"It's the lows in life that make you cherish the highs
And if isn't, I guess I'll be fine believing a lie"


If that "mistake" was a mistake happening, I'll be fine believing a lie. 
You've shown me that love doesn't have to be stressful, have lots of thought, pressure and complexity.
You've shown me a love that is peaceful, steady, smooth and simple.


So back to my Camp Rock story, Since I kinda felt bad about having not opened up as I should have, this should help 🙂:



I’m tall in the room, six-one in the frame,
Loud when I laugh, yeah I’m bad with the volume dial, no shame.
Potatoes and beef on the plate, that’s the plan,
Aquamarine thoughts in a tech-loving man.
Ideas like fireworks, boom after boom,
Lose focus sometimes but I light up the room.
Hip-hop in my step, official when needed,
Coding too late, yeah procrastination undefeated
Smart, talkative, chaos that somehow still lands…
Hi, I’m Alvin



I grew up on Nickelodeon, dreaming of space,
Cosmology kid with stars in his face.
Power Rangers timing, MacGyvering plans,
From Gotham to Hitman, controller in hands.
James Bond confidence, Knives Out wit,
Mission Impossible goals, yeah I’m chasing them quick.
ENTP mind, social battery wild,
Leave me at church for a sec, I’ve adopted a crowd and a child.
Bentley dreams parked right next to my faith…
Hi, I’m Alvin



Now somewhere in here, slow creep, soft turn,
There’s a part of my story I didn’t always learn
How to talk about me, how to pause, how to stay,
How to let someone in when the noise fades away.
I’m clingy, I admit it, hands finding hands,
I lean when you lean, like it’s perfectly planned.
When you say “that’s my boyfriend,” my chest does a flip,
When you get close to me, yeah, the whole world slips.
Princess, boo boo, calm chaos you bring…
Hi, I’m Alvin



At my lowest point, when words felt thin,
You didn’t rush me, you sat within.
You listened me steady, talked light into dark,
Three months in, and you already know my heart.
So this is me, confident, flawed, still true,
A man learning that “me” makes more sense next to “you.”
Not a grand speech, just a quiet unveiling,
If you’re reading this close, then you’re already staying,
And if you ever wonder who’s standing beside you…
Hi, I’m Alvin ❤️





If you want any more, I'll be sure to try open up better. For you.
So yeah, That's right about it 😊. 

I wouldn't want to write to oblivion. This is where kwa insha ningeanza 
"Kalamu yangu inalia wino" type shi 😂. But yeah.

No matter what happens, I still and will always love you baby 😘💖.

Ecclesiastes 4:9–10 (NIV)

“Two are better than one,
because they have a good return for their labor:
If either of them falls down,
one can help the other up.”


All my love,
Alvin ❤️
